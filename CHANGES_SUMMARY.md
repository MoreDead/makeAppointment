# Address Parsing Enhancement - Changes Summary

## Files Modified

### 1. MainActivity.kt

#### Enhanced Gemini Image Analysis Prompt (lines ~247-270)
**Before:**
```kotlin
LOCATION: [Find the complete address/location including all lines up to postcode/zip code]
- Return complete location/address as single line with commas
```

**After:**
```kotlin
LOCATION: [Find the complete address/location and format it properly]
- For LOCATION: Parse all venue/address information and create a properly formatted address
- Reorder address components into proper format: [Building/Venue Name], [Street Number Street Name], [City], [State/Region], [Postcode/ZIP]
- Include hospital/clinic/practice names as the first component if present
- Ensure the address follows standard addressing conventions for the country
- If words appear to be in wrong order (e.g. "Road Hospital Main 123"), reorder them correctly (e.g. "Hospital, 123 Main Road")
- Combine fragmented address parts into a coherent, properly formatted address
```

#### Enhanced Gemini OCR Text Analysis Prompt (lines ~361-390)
**Before:**
```kotlin
LOCATIONS: [list addresses, hospitals, clinics, room numbers, doctor names - separate with commas]
- For locations, include hospitals, clinics, addresses, room numbers, doctor names
```

**After:**
```kotlin
LOCATIONS: [parse and format addresses properly - separate multiple locations with commas]
- For LOCATIONS: Parse venue/address information and create properly formatted addresses
- Reorder address components into proper format: [Building/Venue Name], [Street Number Street Name], [City], [State/Region], [Postcode/ZIP]
- Include hospital/clinic/practice/doctor names as part of the location
- Fix scrambled addresses where words may be in wrong order due to OCR errors
- Examples of corrections:
  * "Road Hospital Main 123" → "Hospital, 123 Main Road"
  * "Suite London 5 Street Baker" → "5 Baker Street, Suite, London"
  * "Center Medical City Health" → "City Health Medical Center"
- Combine fragmented address parts into coherent, properly formatted addresses
- Remove duplicate or redundant address information
```

#### Enhanced Address Processing (lines ~303-315, ~407-432)
**Before:**
```kotlin
// Simple parsing and adding to locations list
locations.add(locationStr)
```

**After:**
```kotlin
// Enhanced parsing with address formatting
val enhancedLocation = enhanceAddressFormatting(locationStr)
locations.add(enhancedLocation)

// For multiple locations:
val rawLocations = locationStr.split(",").map { it.trim() }.filter { it.isNotEmpty() }
val enhancedLocations = rawLocations.map { enhanceAddressFormatting(it) }
locations.addAll(enhancedLocations)
```

#### New Address Enhancement Functions (lines ~661-840)

**New Functions Added:**
1. `enhanceAddressFormatting(rawAddress: String): String`
   - Main function that categorizes and reorders address components
   - Handles comma-separated components and single-string scrambled addresses

2. `reorderScrambledAddress(address: String): String`
   - Parses individual words and categorizes them by type
   - Reconstructs addresses in logical order

3. Helper functions:
   - `isPostcode(text: String): Boolean` - Detects UK, US, Canadian postcodes
   - `isRoomSuite(text: String): Boolean` - Identifies room/suite information
   - `isBuildingName(text: String): Boolean` - Recognizes medical facilities and buildings
   - `isStreetAddress(text: String): Boolean` - Identifies street addresses
   - `isLikelyCity(text: String): Boolean` - Detects city names

## Key Technical Features

### Address Component Categorization
The system now categorizes address parts into:
- **Building/Venue Names**: Hospitals, clinics, medical centers, etc.
- **Street Addresses**: Street numbers and names with proper road types
- **Room/Suite Information**: Room 205, Suite A, Unit 5, etc.
- **Cities**: Capitalized place names without address keywords
- **Postcodes**: UK, US, and Canadian postal codes

### Word Reordering Logic
- Identifies scrambled word patterns common in OCR errors
- Recognizes street types, building types, numbers, and room identifiers
- Reconstructs addresses in standard hierarchical format
- Preserves original if parsing fails (graceful fallback)

### Multi-Format Support
- **UK Format**: Building, Street Number Street Name, City, Postcode
- **US Format**: Building, Street Number Street Name, City, State, ZIP
- **Canadian Format**: Building, Street Number Street Name, City, Province, Postal Code

## Integration Points

### 1. Gemini Image Analysis
- Enhanced prompt guides Gemini to format addresses properly from images
- Local enhancement function provides additional refinement

### 2. Gemini OCR Text Analysis  
- Enhanced prompt with specific examples of address corrections
- Handles multiple locations with proper formatting

### 3. Fallback Mechanism
- If Gemini analysis fails, local extraction still benefits from address enhancement
- All address processing paths now use the enhanced formatting

## Benefits Delivered

1. **Standardized Output**: All addresses follow consistent, recognizable formats
2. **OCR Error Correction**: Fixes common word scrambling issues from text recognition
3. **Improved Usability**: Addresses can be directly used in maps and navigation
4. **Professional Presentation**: Clean, properly structured location information
5. **Robust Processing**: Graceful handling of various input formats and error conditions

## Backward Compatibility

- All changes are additive - no existing functionality is removed
- Original address is preserved as fallback if enhancement fails
- App continues to work even if new parsing logic encounters unexpected input
